We are building a website that aggregates and displays all the food served at University of Illinois dining halls.  We will also implement a rating system and design a reccomendation algorithm that suggest foods for our users.  Lastly, we hope to send SMS/email notifications when a user's favorite food is being serverd.

We are using a mySQL database, PHP, and Bootstrap.
